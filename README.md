Streaming Audio Visualizer for Holiday Chrome
=============================

This Chrome app builds up the holiday-chrome code base http://github.com/moorescloud/chrome-holiday, and implements
a real-time basic visualization of the streaming Classical FM station.  

THe visualization is not very interesting, just flickering lights. But everything is there for frequency and time-domain analysis, using the most excellent Web Audio API.

This code can be adapted for your own sound visualization apps for Holiday by MooresCloud.

This use the super-fast UDP-based SecretAPI, which is documented at https://github.com/moorescloud/secretapi
